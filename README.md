# MA544 Project: Predicting Default of CC Clients
# Authors: Hai Huang, Santino Roma, James Surless
For this project, using a data set [Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) containing information on the default of credit card clients in Tiawan from 2006, we sought to create a logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors model to compare results. Additionally, we utilized principal component analysis for feature extraction in order to retain information during the process of dimensionality reduction.
